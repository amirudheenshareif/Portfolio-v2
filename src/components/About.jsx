           I’m a developer who enjoys working across the full stack with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. I build applications that connect clean front-end design with reliable back-end systems. Along the way, I’ve been exploring how AI can make tools smarter and more useful, and what excites me most is applying these skills to projects that tackle real-world challenges where web development and AI come together.
